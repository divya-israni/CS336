## Mortgage Database Project
 
### Overview
 
This repository contains the work for the mortgage database project, completed in 3 parts. The project involves building a database and performing normalization on mortgage data for the state of New Jersey.
 
 ### Project Breakdown:
 
 - **Project 0**: Creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on the mortgage data and uploading the data to PostgreSQL.
 - **Project 1**: Normalization of the database to 3rd Normal Form (3NF), ensuring that all tables adhere to functional dependencies and eliminate redundancies.
 - **Project 2**: Development of a program that uses a local LLM to interact with the database via natural language and SQL queries.
 
Worked on with other members of my group.
