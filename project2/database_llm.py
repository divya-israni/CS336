QUESTION: How many mortgages have a loan value greater than the applicant income?
ANSWER:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM loan
JOIN applicant ON loan.loan_id = applicant.loan_id
WHERE loan.loan_amount_000s > applicant.applicant_income_000s;

QUESTION: What is the average income of owner occupied applications?
ANSWER:
SELECT AVG(applicant.applicant_income_000s) AS avg_income
FROM loan
JOIN applicant ON loan.loan_id = applicant.loan_id
JOIN property ON loan.property_id = property.property_id
WHERE property.owner_occupancy = 1;

    Your task:
    1. Read the database schema and examples below.
    2. Convert the user question into a **single, fully correct SQL SELECT query**.
    3. Return ONLY the SQL query, ending with a semicolon. DO NOT include any explanations or extra text.

    DATABASE SCHEMA:
    {schema}

    EXAMPLES:
    {examples}

    STRICT RULES:
    - Output only a syntactically correct SQL SELECT query.
    - DO NOT use tables or columns that are not defined in the schema.
    - JOIN tables explicitly when the question involves fields from more than one table.
    - Prefer JOINs over correlated subqueries â€” avoid subqueries in WHERE or SELECT clauses.
    - Always qualify ambiguous column names with their table name (e.g., applicant.applicant_income_000s).
    - Use INNER JOIN unless the question implies otherwise.
    - Do not guess values (e.g., "approved" = 1) unless clearly stated or shown in schema.
    - End the query with a semicolon.
    - Do not return any text other than the SQL query itself.
    - To join Loan and Applicant tables, use the loan_id column.
    - To join Loan and Property tables, use the property_id column.
